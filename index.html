    <hl>This is my transcription from Knox's Three Tracts</hl>
    <p>Many regulations are wanting for securing good usage to these unhappy people, which no authority, but that of parliament,</p>
    <p>can enforce, and it is most reproachful to this country, that there are more than five hundred thousand of its subjects, for</p>
    <p>whom the legislature has never shewn the least regard.  All regulations, it is true, would be preposterous if the servitude of</p>
    <p>these people be unlawful; but then it is still more reproachful to this country, that so great a number of its subjects are</p>
    <p>unlawfully made slaves.  On all accounts therefore the lawfulmess of the thing must first be determined.  When the lords the</p>
    <p>bishops have declared their opinion of the divine law, an act of parliament will be sufficient to decide what shall be human</p>
    <p>law; and until the first is declared, it would be presumption to offer any regulations to be made by the other.</p>
